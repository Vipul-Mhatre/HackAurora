# HackAurora

HackAurora is an integrated project that combines blockchain smart contract development with a predictive modeling engine and a modern web front-end. The project leverages Ethereum smart contracts (using Hardhat), a machine learning-based predictive model, and a user-friendly application interface to deliver a comprehensive decentralized solution.

## Overview

HackAurora brings together several cutting-edge technologies to create an end-to-end solution:
- **Blockchain:** Solidity smart contracts enable decentralized functionality.
- **Predictive Modeling:** A dedicated module implements data analytics and machine learning to forecast and analyze trends.
- **Frontend Application:** A responsive web interface allows users to interact with the system.
- **Automation & CI/CD:** GitHub workflows and scripts streamline development and deployment.

## Features

- **Decentralized Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity and managed using Hardhat.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Python-based predictive model with potential applications in finance, supply chain, or analytics.
- **Modern Web Frontend:** A complete user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Automated test suite for smart contracts and integration testing for application components.
- **Developer Automation:** GitHub configuration for CI/CD, issue templates, and other workflow enhancements.

## Directory Structure

Below is an in-depth explanation of the project directories and key files:

- **.github**  
  Contains GitHub-specific configurations such as workflow definitions, issue templates, and pull request templates. This folder is essential for automating CI/CD pipelines and ensuring consistent collaboration standards.

- **PredictiveModel**  
  Houses the predictive modeling code, including data processing scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and possibly trained model files. This module uses Python libraries (such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow) to perform statistical forecasting and machine learning tasks.

- **appfrontend**  
  The front-end application code lives here. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React/Angular if applicable), this directory provides the user interface that interacts with the blockchain backend and visualizes the predictive analytics.

- **contracts**  
  Contains the Solidity smart contracts that underpin the blockchain functionality. These contracts define key operations like asset management, transaction processing, and decentralized data storage. They are compiled and tested using Hardhat.

- **scripts**  
  Includes various scripts that automate tasks such as smart contract deployment, migration, and utility operations. These scripts ease development by providing reproducible commands to interact with the blockchain network.

- **test**  
  This folder holds all the test cases for the smart contracts (and potentially integration tests for other modules). Testing ensures that the contracts and application functions as expected, maintaining the integrity and security of the system.

- **.gitattributes & .gitignore**  
  Standard Git configuration files that manage repository settings and exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from version control.

- **4.5.0**  
  A version file or configuration marker. This file may denote compatibility or specific versioning details for one of the project components. (Review its contents to determine its precise role.)

- **_config.yml**  
  A configuration file often used by GitHub Pages or static site generators to define settings for project documentation or hosted websites.

- **djfnja.txt**  
  An auxiliary text file. Its purpose is project-specificâ€”it might serve as a placeholder, provide notes, or include legacy information relevant to the project.

- **hardhat.config.js**  
  The configuration file for Hardhat. It specifies compiler settings, network configurations, and plugins necessary for developing, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts.

- **package-lock.json & package.json**  
  These Node.js files manage the front-end dependencies and scripts. They ensure that all developers use consistent dependency versions and help automate tasks such as building or running the application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (or Yarn)
- **Hardhat CLI** for smart contract development
- **Python 3.x** for the predictive model
- (Optional) Additional blockchain tools if required by your development environment

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ronit26Mehta/HackAurora.git
   cd HackAurora
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. **Set Up the Predictive Model Environment:**
   Navigate to the `PredictiveModel` directory and install any Python dependencies (ensure a `requirements.txt` exists):
   ```bash
   cd PredictiveModel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Frontend Application

- Change to the `appfrontend` directory and start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd appfrontend
   npm start
   ```
- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with the application.

### Working with Smart Contracts

1. **Compile Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Deploy to a Local Network:**
   Start a local Hardhat node:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```
   Then, in another terminal, deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Running the Predictive Model

- Navigate to the `PredictiveModel` directory and run your main script:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```
- You can also open and run the provided Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and visualization.

## Testing

- **Smart Contract Testing:**
  Run the tests using Hardhat:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
- **Additional Tests:**
  If there are tests for other modules, refer to the instructions in the respective directories.

## Deployment

- Update network configurations in `hardhat.config.js` as needed for production deployment.
- Utilize GitHub Actions (configured under `.github`) for automated deployment workflows.
- Secure your deployment by using environment variables and secure wallet management when interacting with live networks.
